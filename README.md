### About Me

Hello, Im Randy Brown and I am getting get my bachelor's degree 
in Computer Science and expecting to graduate in May 2025.

My passion for programming came from playing flash games found
on websites such as ArmorGames and CoolMathGames. I always had 
these crazy ideas on how to create a fun game.

When I first got into my programming class, I got to see some 
of the applications computer science could be used for like
creating 3D animations using Alice.

Then, I went to college and found out about so many other
languages and other software used in many different fields. I
strive to make myself impactful to the world.
